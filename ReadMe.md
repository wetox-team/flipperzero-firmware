# Contributing

<<<<<<< HEAD
Welcome to the [Wetox Flipper Zero](https://wetox.team/)'s Firmware repo!
This is a modified unofficial version of the Flipper Zero firmware with some additional features.

# If you want to incorporate our features into your firmware fork, please contact us beforehand!

# Feature list

* Removing T5577 passwords via the cli command `rfid clear_pass_t5577` using a dictionary attack
* Support for inverted screens via a toggle in the desktop settings
=======
Our main goal is to build a healthy and sustainable community around Flipper, so we're open to any new ideas and contributions. We also have some rules and taboos here, so please read this page and our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) carefully.

## I need help

The best place to search for answers is our [User Documentation](https://docs.flipperzero.one). If you can't find the answer there, check our [Discord Server](https://flipp.dev/discord) or our [Forum](https://forum.flipperzero.one/).

## I want to report an issue

If you've found an issue and want to report it, please check our [Issues](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/issues) page. Make sure the description contains information about the firmware version you're using, your platform, and a clear explanation of the steps to reproduce the issue.

## I want to contribute code

Before opening a PR, please confirm that your changes must be contained in the firmware. Many ideas can easily be implemented as external applications and published in the [Flipper Application Catalog](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipper-application-catalog). If you are unsure, reach out to us on the [Discord Server](https://flipp.dev/discord) or the [Issues](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/issues) page, and we'll help you find the right place for your code.

Also, please read our [Contribution Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Coding Style](/CODING_STYLE.md), and make sure your code is compatible with our [Project License](/LICENSE).

Finally, open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/pulls) and make sure that CI/CD statuses are all green.

# Development

Flipper Zero Firmware is written in C, with some bits and pieces written in C++ and armv7m assembly languages. An intermediate level of C knowledge is recommended for comfortable programming. C, C++, and armv7m assembly languages are supported for Flipper applications.

# Firmware RoadMap

[Firmware RoadMap Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO_3D6xU=/)

## Requirements

Supported development platforms:

- Windows 10+ with PowerShell and Git (x86_64)
- macOS 12+ with Command Line tools (x86_64, arm64)
- Ubuntu 20.04+ with build-essential and Git (x86_64)

Supported in-circuit debuggers (optional but highly recommended):

- [Flipper Zero Wi-Fi Development Board](https://shop.flipperzero.one/products/wifi-devboard)
- ST-Link
- J-Link

Flipper Build System will take care of all the other dependencies.

## Cloning source code

Make sure you have enough space and clone the source code:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git
```

## Building

<<<<<<< HEAD
Flipper Zero's firmware consists of two components:

- Core2 firmware set - proprietary components by ST: FUS + radio stack. FUS is flashed at factory and you should never update it.
- Core1 Firmware - HAL + OS + Drivers + Applications.

They both must be flashed in the order described.

## With offline update package

With Flipper attached over USB:

`./fbt flash_usb`

Just building the package:

`./fbt updater_package`

To update, copy the resulting directory to Flipper's SD card and navigate to `update.fuf` file in Archive app. 

## With STLink

### Core1 Firmware

Prerequisites:

- Linux / macOS
- Terminal
- [arm-gcc-none-eabi](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
- openocd


One liner: `./fbt firmware_flash`


## With USB DFU 

1. Download latest [Firmware](https://github.com/wetox-team/flipperzero-firmware/releases)

2. Reboot Flipper to Bootloader
 - Press and hold `← Left` + `↩ Back` for reset 
 - Release `↩ Back` and keep holding `← Left` until blue LED lights up
 - Release `← Left`

3. Run `dfu-util -D full.dfu -a 0`

# Build with Docker

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker Engine and Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. Prepare the container:

 ```sh
 docker-compose up -d
 ```

## Compile everything

```sh
docker-compose exec dev ./fbt
```

Check `dist/` for build outputs.

Use **`flipper-z-{target}-full-{suffix}.dfu`** to flash your device.

If compilation fails, make sure all submodules are all initialized. Either clone with `--recursive` or use `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

# Build on Linux/macOS

Check out `documentation/fbt.md` for details on building and flashing firmware. 

## macOS Prerequisites

Make sure you have [brew](https://brew.sh) and install all the dependencies:
```sh
brew bundle --verbose
```

## Linux Prerequisites

### gcc-arm-none-eabi

```sh
toolchain="gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10"
toolchain_package="$toolchain-$(uname -m)-linux"

wget -P /opt "https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/10.3-2021.10/$toolchain_package.tar.bz2"

tar xjf /opt/$toolchain_package.tar.bz2 -C /opt
rm /opt/$toolchain_package.tar.bz2

for file in /opt/$toolchain/bin/* ; do ln -s "${file}" "/usr/bin/$(basename ${file})" ; done
```

### Optional dependencies

- openocd (debugging/flashing over SWD)
- heatshrink (compiling image assets)
- clang-format (code formatting)
- dfu-util (flashing over USB DFU)
- protobuf (compiling proto sources)

For example, to install them on Debian, use:
```sh
apt update
apt install openocd clang-format-13 dfu-util protobuf-compiler
```

heatshrink has to be compiled [from sources](https://github.com/atomicobject/heatshrink).

## Compile everything

```sh
=======
Build firmware using Flipper Build Tool:

```shell
>>>>>>> upstream/dev
./fbt
```

## Flashing firmware using an in-circuit debugger

Connect your in-circuit debugger to your Flipper and flash firmware using Flipper Build Tool:

```shell
./fbt flash
```
Or connect via the blackmagic board and run:
```sh
BLACKMAGIC=<board's IP>:2345 make blackmagic_load
```

## Flashing firmware using USB

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Telegram: [@wetox_flipper](https://t.me/wetox_flipper)
=======
Make sure your Flipper is on, and your firmware is functioning. Connect your Flipper with a USB cable and flash firmware using Flipper Build Tool:

```shell
./fbt flash_usb
```
